## Portfolio Backend Server

This project provides a robust backend server designed to host and manage portfolio data for developers. It enables developers to store, update, and retrieve their personal and professional information, which can then be used to power frontend applications like websites or mobile apps. The server includes endpoints for key portfolio sections such as projects, accomplishments, education, contact information, experience, skills, testimonials, certifications, languages, and blog posts.

### Features:

- **CRUD Operations:** Developers can create, read, update, and delete their portfolio data.
- **Secure Access:** Authentication and authorization mechanisms ensure only authorized users can modify the data.
- **Data Aggregation:** The `/home` endpoint aggregates and provides a summary of the portfolio data.
- **Modular Design:** Structured using controllers, models, routes, and middleware for maintainability and scalability.
- **Ready for Deployment:** Can be easily hosted on any cloud service to make the portfolio accessible online.

This backend server provides a foundation for developers to showcase their work and credentials through a customizable and secure platform.
